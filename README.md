# Vim WhiteSpace Trailing
Highlights trailing whitespace in red and provides :FixWhitespace to fix it.

### Info

This plugin causes trailing whitespace to be highlighted in red.

To fix the whitespace errors, call :FixWhitespace.  By default it
operates on the entire file.  Pass a range (or use V to select some lines)
to restrict the portion of the file that gets fixed.
